This is a template project for Android Studio that allows you to create an android webview application . You can use it to create a simple app for your website or as a starting point for your HTML5 based android app.

And additionally this is an Hybrid App which means that it combines elements of both native and Web applications.

I have changed the URL for the app as http://www.goal.com
